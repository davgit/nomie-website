When I started coding Nomie (Mento at the time), I was reading [Jonathan Haidt's Happiness Hypothesis](https://www.happinesshypothesis.com/). In the book, Jonathan makes references to the concept of the [Elephant and the Rider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9KP8uiGZTs). The idea is that you are both the elephant and the rider. You, as the conscious rider, must learn to work and manage your inner elephant - who is, for all intents and purposes, an animal.

## Few other Points

1. Elephants Don't Forget
2. The buddha said that meditation was like "caging the elephant" - calming the inner animal.
3. Nomie helps ease into addressing the elephant in the room.

## Evolution all around

Just like the Nomie app, the Nomie logo has gone through a lot of evolution over the last 4.5 years.
