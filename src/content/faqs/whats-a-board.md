When you first open Nomie, you only have 1 board to hold your trackers. This is called the "All" board. If you upgrade to Unlimited trackers, you'll be able to create new boards to help organize your trackers. For example, you might have a board called "Morning" with a Coffee Tracker, Sleep Quality Tracker and a Mood Tracker. While on your Fitness board you would only include your fitness related trackers.
