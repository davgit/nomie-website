Not directly, you can use Nomie's calendar import and the great iOS app Workflow to get close.

1. Tap the Settings tab
2. Select Import Data
3. Select Import from Calendar
4. Enable "Auto Import from Calendar"
5. Launch Workflow and create a new workflow that generates a Calendar Event.

- Make sure the title of the event has #nomie in it.
- In the event Notes you can put any content and Nomie will track it. For example: #mood(4)
