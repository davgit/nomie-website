The latest version of Nomie supports importing backups from all previous version of Nomie. This will step you through generating a backup file for Nomie 1 and Nomie 2.

Both versions require you to have a [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) account to create a Nomie backup. Yes I know that sucks, but at the time mobile devices really didn't offer the ability to download files to your device.

1. Open Nomie 2, and got the Settings tabs
2. Select Dropbox Backup
3. Login to Dropbox
4. Select "Backup Now"

This will generate a Backup file that can be imported into Nomie 5. To do that, on your device:

1. Login to Dropbox
2. Browse to where your backup was saved
3. Save that to your device.
4. Login to the current version of Nomie
5. Go to Settings
6. Go to Data / Import from Backup
7. Select your backup file and follow the steps.
