# How do I upgrade Nomie to the latest version?

Long story short, you don't. Instead, you setup a new version of Nomie, and import your data from the older version.

Long story long: I am not a fan of force updates, I'm also not a fan of being tied down by my own creations. So intead Nomie each major point release of Nomie is it's own stand alone application. With the only way to bring old data in, is using the import/export feature of both version of Nomie.
