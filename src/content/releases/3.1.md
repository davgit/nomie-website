It's been around a month since I released Nomie 3 on iOS. Feedback has been really great, and the downloads are are happening. All in all, I'm happy with the progress of Nomie 3.

In this release, I fixed a handful of annoying little bugs.

### Fixes

- Emoji now properly changes if you change the default
- Rounding inconsistencies made consistent
- Fixed Reminders stopping after a week
- 2 Character tags now supported
- Fixed missing 7p on reminder creator
- Fixed bar chart label alignment

### Enhancements:

- Timer display better fitted
- Added description to stats panel
- Note Tracking now will add # where you're cursor is focused, instead of just the end of the note.
