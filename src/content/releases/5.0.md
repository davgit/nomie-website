## Nomie 5!

Thank you Covid-19, you have afforded me the time to finally bring a bunch of features to Nomie that the users and myself have been wanting.

## What's new in Nomie 5

### New Domain!

Like past version of Nomie, you are not forced to upgrade. Instead, Nomie 5 will run at https://v5.nomie.app letting Nomie 4 continue to run for those that don't want to upgrade. Nomie 1,2,3,4 users who want to start using Nomie 5, will need to export their data from their current version of Nomie, and import it into Nomie 5.

Blockstack users, Blockstack will see this as a completely new site, and will keep Nomie 4 and Nomie 5 data separate.

### New Design

This version brings a lot of small attention to details. Better looking tracker buttons, improved log list, stats completely redesigned.

### Track other Trackers while tracking ðŸ¤”!

Use case: each time I track Wine or Beer, I also want to track Alcohol. By including #alcohol(\*), now each time you tap beer or wine, #alcohol will be included, and have the same value.
