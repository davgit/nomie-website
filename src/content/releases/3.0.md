![OMG NOMIE 3 IS AVAIL FOR IOS](https://snaps.nomie.io/Screen-Shot-2018-09-20-20-27-34.png)

TL;DR: Nomie 3 is ready for iOS, [view it in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nomie-3/id1350582411?ls=1&mt=8)

<a href="/podcast/16-nomie-release-3-for-ios-is" class="n-button">Hear me talk about it on Eps.16</a>

Just [8 months ago I walked away from Nomie](https://www.reddit.com/r/nomie/comments/7cyi01/this_feels_like_the_end/), only to quickly realize how much I needed it. [I went back to the drawing board](https://www.reddit.com/r/nomie/comments/7hl2th/this_feels_like_the_beginning/), and starting from scratch started creating a new vision for Nomie.

## What is Nomie 3?

Generally, Nomie is an app that lets you privately track anything in your life. It's like My Fitness Pal, but for anything you want. Plus you can see how the things you track relate, you'll discover patterns, and you'll have a running log of your life. Nomie 3 is the 3rd generation of the Nomie brand.

Nomie 3 is a completely new stand alone product. Users of Nomie 1 or Nomie 2 will need to go to the App Store and install Nomie 3.

## Squat Challenge example

The best way to show you how Nomie works, is to walk you though setting a tracker and a goal. Let's use the Squat Challenge as an example. You want to do 100 squats every day - so you're going to create a numeric squat tracker, and a goal. Let's do that now.

### Creating a Squats Counter Tracker

Step 1. In Nomie 3, press the "Add Button" on the "Track" tab
