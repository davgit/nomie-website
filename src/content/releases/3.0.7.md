## Export with CSV or JSON

You can now export your data to CSV or JSON. Unlike Nomie 2, the export contains the notes! The CSV extracts each tracker and adds it as it's own row.

## Simplified "Create Tracker" flow

When creating a new Tracker you'll be stepped through the process, one field at a time.

## Goals Tab

Goals have been promoted to its own tab! Also, Tabs have labels now.

## In-App Purchases

The beginning of In App Purchases has begun. Nomie will limit the number of trackers visible on the board to 9, and the number of goals to 3 by default. Users can pay a one time fee to remove these limits.

## Hiding Trackers from the Board

Trackers now have an option to "hide from board", when enabled the tracker will not be a visible button on the track board.
