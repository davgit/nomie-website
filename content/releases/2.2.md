Nomie 2.2 took me longer than normal due to a nasty bug that basically crippled Nomie for iOS. Fortunately, after working around the bug - a whole new world of potential opened up. The first example is the new real-time search that's available for your Nomie Notes.

Here's the overview

## Nomie Pro is now called Nomie 2.

Nomie Pro was a stupid idea - so I'm going to with Semantic Versioning from here on out. This means that each version of Nomie that might break your local data will become a completely new installable app. For example, Nomie 3, Nomie 4.

## Note Search

Thanks for a bug that I had to work around, I was able to add the ability to search through notes, in real time.

## Note usability

The note viewer has also been improved.

## Improved Today View

The Today View has been streamlined. Tracker values are now more obvious.

## Notification / Awards

Nomie will now give you awards for various activities - like creating your own tracker, using Nomie for a certain period of time, etc. Cloud Apps can also take advantage of the Notification system. Big Spender for example will create a notification when you've exceeded your weekly spending limit.

## Board Sorting (for iOS Users)

Board Sorting is now available for iOS users too.
