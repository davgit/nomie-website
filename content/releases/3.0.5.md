# 3.0.5 - March 25th 2018

Howdy friends! Here's what I got done over this week and weekend.

If you'd like to get on the iOS testing team - visit: EXPIRED

## Timers Tracker Type

Timers work pretty much the same as they did in Nomie 2. You'll tap to start the timer, and then tap to stop.

## One-Tap Tracking

If you have a 'tap' tracker type, you can now set an option to "One-tap", which will make the button function much like Nomie 2.

## Goals

Goals! Sure they are pretty basic right now - but you can set a min/max for day, week, month for a tracker. For example, drink more than 40oz of water daily.

## Day and Month Score

You'll now see a day and month score on the stream page. This score is calculated based on total average of all scores.

## Dynamic Scores

A tracker score can be modified based on time of day, total tracks that day, and specific value.
