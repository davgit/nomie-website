**Improved Search** - you can now search using AND and OR. For example "@mom OR @dad" or "@mom AND dinner".

**Saved Search Terms** - search is it's own dedicated view, that starts off with a list of your previous searches

**Offline Save Queue:** If you use Blockstack, and you’re internet drops, logs will now be saved to an offline queue, that you can sync to Blockstack when you come back online.

**Faster Date/Time changing**: Tap the ••• more ball, and quickly change the day using arrows, tap the hour, or minutes to change
