**For the new folks**: Nomie is an app I've been building, using and sharing to help privately track any aspect of your life. Learn more https://nomie.app. Me, I'm [Brandon Corbin](https://twitter.com/brandoncorbin) a guy from Indianapolis who decided to take control of his demons by tracking them.

What's new in this version of Nomie:

## 24 Hour Clock

Previous Nomie was very AM/PM centric, this version brings the option to switch between AM/PM or 24H.

## Popular Hashtags

I've rewritten the hashtag indexer - it's now much faster, requires less space and works in real time. This upgrade also allowed me to bring back the "Popular Tags" tab of yesteryear.

## Ignoring Zeros

For trackers like Weight, you need the ability to ignore days you don't track - now you can. Slider and Number trackers have the option to "Ignore Zeros"

## Improved Tracker Stats

Landscape those stats!

Overall design improvements continue on the Stats Overview screen, focusing on flexibility across multiple devices and tracker / uom types.

Nomie now includes the value of the first and last time you tracked.

Charts have been given an overhaul and now allow you to pick the type of chart, if the data is grouped, and if the data should be balanced (to level out 2 different datasets with large variations)

## CouchDB Syncing Improvements

CouchDB now updates in real time. Track on one device and all other devices update immediately - the days of waiting until the next restart are gone.
