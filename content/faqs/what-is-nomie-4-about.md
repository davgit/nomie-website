Nomie 4 is the combination of Nomie 1, 2, and 3 into a new web based app that is also available under the MIT license. Nomie 4 runs in the browser, but I recommend you "add to homescreen" for the best overall experience.

- Nomie 4 production can be used at https://open.nomie.app
- Nomie 4 development can be used at https://dev.nomie.app

Note: your data does not sync between development and production, you will need to export and import your data if you want to switch between the two. Also, it's important to note that the Dev branch changes multiple times a day that might partially break things.

### Update

- Nomie 5 production can be used at https://v5.nomie.app
- Nomie 5 development can be used at https://v5-dev.nomie.app
