# Ran out of trackers and don't want to upgrade?

If you're like me, you might be on the frugal side. If you'd rather not upgrade to unlimited trackers - I get it.

While you won't have a tracker button or the ability to configure the tracker, you can track any data by adding to the note field ("What's up") #trackername(value) or just #trackername

For example: `Today was a good day, #mood(5) #water(44)`, once it's tracked you can access stats by visiting your timeline and long pressing on the tracked value.
