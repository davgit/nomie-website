### Backstory

Nomie 1 and Nomie 2 both default to a "One Tap Tracker" - meaning you simply tapped the button to record.. But this lead to a lot of false tracks and noisy data. Nomie 3 on the other hand, focuses more on grouping tracked events into a single record. Meaning, you can track sleep, sleep quality, and mood all in the same record. Future versions of Nomie will use these groupings for analysis.

### Enable one-tap recording on a tracker.

1. Long press the tracker
2. Select "Edit Tracker"
3. Enable the "One Tap Record" option.

Note: one-tap is not available for timer tracker types.
