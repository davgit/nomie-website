I've been sitting on this release for a few months as it will mark the end of new feature development for Nomie 5. From this point on, only bug fixes will be applied to N5, as I work on a massive refactor that will become Nomie 6.

Here are some of the bigger changes in Nomie 5.6

## New Button Views for non-Patrons

## Better offline message queue support

Offline log queue for Blockstack users now allows you to see all of the logs in the queue, and delete specific ones.

- Quarterly view will now show as days instead of weeks.
- When comparing selecting a specific time will now highlight all visible charts, and display the value for the selected date.

## Long Press now automatically tracks the default value & starts/stops a timer.

...or for Timers it will automatically start and stop the timer. Thanks to Patron member JMorris for this killer recommendation.

### Improved Popmenu
